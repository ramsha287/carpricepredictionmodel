# CarWorth - Car Price Prediction and Comparison App

CarWorth is a web-based application built using Streamlit that helps users predict car prices, recommend car options based on user preferences, compare different car models, and determine a fair price range for a given car. The app uses machine learning models to estimate car prices and provide users with data-driven insights on car market trends.

## Features:


Car Price Prediction: Predict the price of a car based on features like brand, model, year, mileage, and more.

Car Recommendations: Get car recommendations based on your preferences and budget.

Car Comparison: Compare multiple cars side-by-side to evaluate features and prices.

Fair Price Estimation: Analyze the price of a specific car to determine if it is fairly priced based on current market data.

## Technologies Used:


Python: The core programming language for building the app.

Streamlit: Framework for creating the interactive web interface.

Machine Learning: Used to predict car prices based on historical data and trends.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation.
